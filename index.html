    <h1>Badminton</h1>
    <p> I have been playing badminton since I was 16 years old. Badminton is the fastest racket sport in the world. Faster than ping pong, faster than tennis, and faster than squash. In fact, itâ€™s even faster than golf (the ball speed, not just the gameplay!). This makes badminton not only exciting to play, but also incredibly exciting to watch. It keeps players engaged with the game because everyone on court needs to stay aware and ready for the next shot. </p>
    <p> Here are some link to watch about badminton: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIj03RsGrJA/">video!</a></p>
